## Usage Guide

### Creating a New Room

1. Visit the home page
2. Enter your username
3. Click "new room" to generate a unique Room ID
4. Click "Join" to enter the room
5. Share the Room ID with collaborators

### Joining an Existing Room

1. Get the Room ID from your team member
2. Enter the Room ID in the input field
3. Enter your username
4. Click "Join" or press Enter

### Collaborating in Real-time

- **Write Code**: Start typing in the editor - changes sync instantly
- **See Connected Users**: View all active participants in the left sidebar

## Key Components

### Home Component
- Room ID generation using UUID v4
- Input validation
- Room creation and joining logic

### EditorPage Component
- Real-time user list management
- Socket event handling
- Code synchronization
- Connection management

### Editor Component
- CodeMirror integration
- Real-time change detection
- Code broadcasting

### Server
- Room management
- User connection handling
- Event broadcasting
- Code synchronization logic

## Socket Events

| Event | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `JOIN` | Client → Server | User joins a room |
| `JOINED` | Server → Client | Broadcast new user joined |
| `DISCONNECTED` | Server → Client | User left the room |
| `CODE_CHANGE` | Client → Server | Code was modified |
| `SYNC_CODE` | Client → Server | Request current code state |

## Environment Variables

Currently, the application uses port 5000 by default. To customize:

```bash
PORT=3000 npm start
```

## Browser Support

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Opera

WebSocket support required (all modern browsers)

## Performance Optimizations

- Code debouncing for efficient synchronization
- Minimal re-renders with React refs
- Optimized Socket.IO event handlers
- Production-ready build with minification
- Static asset caching

## Security Considerations

- Room IDs use UUID v4 (cryptographically random)
- No authentication required for quick collaboration
- Client-side validation for inputs
- XSS protection via React's built-in escaping

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Verify firewall settings
- Ensure WebSocket support in browser

### Code Not Syncing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Socket.IO connection status
- Refresh the page and rejoin room

### Build Errors
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
- Run `npm install` again
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- [ ] File upload and download
- [ ] Code execution environment
- [ ] Video/audio chat integration
- [ ] Persistent room history
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Access control and permissions
- [ ] Code versioning and history
- [ ] Collaborative cursor tracking
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
